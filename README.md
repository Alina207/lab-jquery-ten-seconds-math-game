# JS | Simon Game

## Learning Goals

After this learning unit, you will be able to:

- Build your own Simon game, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Introduction

Simon is a game of memory skill launched for the first time in 1978 by [Studio 54](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_54) in New York City. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. Once the user fails, the game is over.

If you have never played before, you can try it in this [online version](http://www.freesimon.org/). It will be very helpful to understand how does it works.

## Planning the game

Let's analyze step by step what are we going to need. The device will have 4 different buttons, distributed in a circle. On the center, we will have the counter, that will increment while the player move forward in the rounds.

To start the game, we need an engine to generate random colors. We will start by generating one color, and each round we will increase the difficulty by adding a new color randomly.

Finally, if the player fails, we have to show him/her a message indicating that the game is over, and generate a new game to start over again.

We are going to work over a possible solution. Feel free to find a better solution by your own and share it with the rest of the class :)

**// Happy coding**

## First iteration: HTML

## Second iteration: CSS

## Third iteration: JavaScript

## Summary

We learnt how to solve a big problem, like a game, splitting it up into small steps. First of all we have did the HTML, then the CSS, and finally the JavaScript.
